# Object detection with Tensorflow 2 and Pytorch pretrained models

Objective of this repository to demostrate how easy is to build an object detection algorithm with pretraned massive models. 
To show the power of these models, I did not finetune the models and only used the pretraned weights, no additional laysers or training dataset utilised.
